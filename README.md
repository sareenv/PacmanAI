# Pacman

The repository contains the implmentation of various state search algorithms both including the heuristic and non heuristic search algorithm. The aim of the project was to develop  AI system which can automate the gameplay of the search agent in the famous PAC game. Following are some of the algorithms implmented to develop the AI system.

- DFS (Depth First Search)
- BFS (Breath First Search)
- UCS (Uniform Cost Search)
- A* Search Algorithm (Based on Manhattan Distance).

Besides, implementation of the state search algorithms, various other helper methods were implemented to support the implementation. 

# Credits 
The project idea and the starter code belongs to the BerkeleyAI labs which provided the challeges to implement these algorithms.
